This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

## ðŸ”— Wallet Connection

The workspace automatically chooses the best wallet connection method:

### With Privy (Enhanced Experience)
Set these environment variables for full Privy integration:
```bash
VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID=your_privy_app_id
VITE_PRIVY_CLIENT_ID=your_privy_client_id
```
**Features**: Embedded wallets, social login, seamless UX

### Without Privy (Standard Experience)  
No configuration needed - automatically falls back to an injected provider
**Features**: Standard wallet connection, works with all major wallets

### Unified API
Components use a single `useWallet()` hook that works with both providers:

```typescript
const { address, isConnected, connect, disconnect } = useWallet()
// Works identically whether using Privy or an injected provider!
```
